# Linear Regression models

This was prepared as an assignment to the Mathematical Data Science course I undertook at TU Delft, 2021. Notebook demonstrates the various linear regression models (least squares, ridge, lasso, elasticnet) applied on the Stockholm prostrate cancer database.

To use the presentation notebook interactively, you will need to have the Julia package [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) installed. Along with the following dependencies:
- LinearAlgebra
- Lasso.jl
- Plots.jl
- DataFrames.jl
- CSV.jl
